GOTCHA: the escape dilemma

> i also tried to escape strings using a function on the server but it did nothing. idk what the issue was. but passing it through stringify twice did the trick   


#### Single Stringify on the Server
_viewItemDetails.js (server)_

```
    let data_str = JSON.stringify(data)
```
[Handlebars.js parse object instead of \[Object object\]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10232574/handlebars-js-parse-object-instead-of-object-object)   
hbs.registerHelper('json', function(context) {
    return JSON.stringify(context);
});


_details.hbs (client)_

```
  window['IMG_URL'] = `${location.origin}/core/alight/xfiles/images/`;
  window['ITEM_DATA'] = htmlDecode('{{data_str}}');
  console.log("[item data 1] htmlDecode",ITEM_DATA);

  window['ITEM_DATA'] = '{{{json data_str}}}';

  console.log("[item data 2] data_str passed through helper",ITEM_DATA);

  window['ITEM_DATA'] = '{{{json data}}}';

  console.log("[item data 3] data passed through helper",ITEM_DATA);

  window['ITEM_DATA'] = '{{data_str}}';
  console.log("[item data 4] original",ITEM_DATA);

  window['ITEM_DATA'] = '{{{data_str}}}';
  console.log("[item data 5] tripple bracket",ITEM_DATA);

  window['ITEM_DATA'] = '{{{data}}}';
  console.log("[item data 6] tripple bracket data",ITEM_DATA);
```

#### Single console outputs   

```

[item data 6] tripple bracket data [object Object]
```
#### Observations
- hbs adds html formatting to strings unless we use {{{}}} triple brackets
- passing a string with problematic double quotes through JSON.stringify twice escapes the problem quotes
- double stringify on the server along with triple brackets seems to prep the string nicely, double stringify the og data will probably work too

#### My new js escape process (since unescape is now deprecated)

_unescapeURI_

```
  const unicodeUnEscape = function(string) {
  return string.replace(/%u([\dA-Z]{4})|%([\dA-Z]{2})/g, function(_, m1, m2) {
    return String.fromCharCode(parseInt("0x" + (m1 || m2)));
  })
}

export const unescapeURI = (txt) => {
  let new_txt;
  try {
    new_txt = decodeURI(unicodeUnEscape(txt));
  } catch (error) {
    new_txt = unescape(txt);
  }

  return new_txt;
}
