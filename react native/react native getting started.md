>GOTCHA: don't use 1st IPv4 Address - fails

```

#### [react-native windows?](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/getting-started)   

```
  npx react-native init <projectName>
  cd projectName
  npx react-native-windows-init --overwrite

```
> im not sure what react-native windows does, but it looks like it runs a browser version - maybe even
> creates a webapp (i hope) like expo does

```
  npx react-native-windows-init --overwrite


  npx react-native run-windows

  
```

### installations:

- were going to install dependencies. ESLint optional.
	
> react native has a lot of setup

- google search 'java sdk'
	-java sdk (java jdk)
	>java SE Download (already got it)
	
- g-search node
	-node js (got it)
	
- g-search python 2
	- Python 2
	>windows x86 - 64 MSI installer
	
- g-search android studio download
	-android studio (got it)
	

#### run cmd (node version)   

```
	node -v4
	//v6.10.10
```

#### install react native command line tools   
> generates new project and test project inside android simulator

```
	npm install -g react-native-cli

```

> i also downloaded yarn and installed to speed react-native compiles
[yarn downloads](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)   
			
#### Create system variables/paths

- navigate the the Program Files Java folder and copy address

- then to the systems environment variables

```
	Control Panel > System > Advanced System Settings >
	environment variables > New
	
	variable name: JAVA_HOME
	variable value: paste path
	
	also add to path: C:\Users\LocAdmin\AppData\Local\Android\sdk\platform-tools
	
	then make another New environment variable
	variable name: ANDROID_HOME
	variable value: C:\Users\LocAdmin\AppData\Local\Android\sdk\
```
	
> for this to work fully i had to install and accept the terms for android SDK build-tools rev 23.0.1 ( be careful of similar revision numbers)
> to do this i had to navigate to the android sdk (link is same as ANDROID_HOME)
	
> it will tell you which revision its looking for so you can go and get it.
	
- then open AVD Manager.exe

	
#### create workspace folder 
```
	mkdir react_native
```

- navigate to workspace folder and initialize project

```
	react_native $: react-native init albums
```
	
	

**install gotchas:**
> kept failing
[npm install --save --save-exact react-native` failed](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/13345)
i updated npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/update)
```
	npm update -g

```

i tried to clear the cache but it wouldn't let me w/o a fight & it was unnecessary

[i had to install yarn to speed up the process](https://yarnpkg.com)
also after installing yarn i had to restart the cli for it to recognize yarn

after installing 
react-native init albums

this shows up:

To run your app on iOS:
   cd C:\Users\LocAdmin\version-control\react_native\albums
   react-native run-ios
   - or -
   Open ios\albums.xcodeproj in Xcode
   Hit the Run button
To run your app on Android:
   cd C:\Users\LocAdmin\version-control\react_native\albums
   Have an Android emulator running (quickest way to get started), or a device connected
   react-native run-android

**Gotcha: another red screen issue**
Unable to load script from assets index.android.bundle on windows

[bundle fix](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44446523/unable-to-load-script-from-assets-index-android-bundle-on-windows)

1. (in project directory) mkdir android/app/src/main/assets
2. react-native bundle --platform android --dev false --entry-file index.js --bundle-output android/app/src/main/assets/index.android.bundle --assets-dest android/app/src/main/res
3. react-native run-android

yeaaaaaa, i edited the app.js file and it worked!!!!!

NOW, how do i run it from the wifi using the packager/bundler(if that is your real name)

i did it, but i wanted more to happen.  it doesn't give be the same neat node window which runs alongside my bash/cli but maybe if i needed to do additional codeing with the command line i could just open another window. i simply started the dev app on android and then typed:

```
	react-native start

```

and any updates to app.js are updated on the device.

this opens the dev menu on the device from the cli (without shaking)
```
	adb shell input keyevent 82 
```

i did a test to see if i could omit the adb reverse codeing
``` 

```

[command line reload](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44170991/reload-a-react-native-app-on-an-android-device-manually-via-command-line)

** im already sick of shaking the phone to reload **

```
	adb shell input text "RR"

	or 

	alias reload='adb shell input text "RR"'

	then i can just type reload and it will reload
```

gotcha:
 my device kept shutting down if i used parenthesis around numeric values like padding:'5' or padding:'5px' and possibley because of the reload not set for hot reloading, the app was irreparable
 
 i put padding:'5' and got an error i put padding:'5px' and it crashed

 [Running On Device](https://reactnative.dev/docs/running-on-device)   
 > this seems waayy less complicated than the experiment above.
 
 > i did need to type in the laptops ip address
 ```
  ipconfig 
 ```
 > use :8081 for the port

#### i could also specify a custom port

```
  npx react-native run-android --port 9088 
```

#### possibly helpful when making changes to the workspace structure
```
  npx react-native start

  npx react-native start --reset-cache
```

in a different terminal

```
  npx react-native run-android --verbose
```
