### phpmyadmin droplet
[droplet how tos](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/how-to/)
[create phpMyAdmin droplet](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/phpmyadmin)  
## **GOTCHA: i had an issue with 2 droplets not adding the image i was requesting.  finally i used this link to create the phpMyAdmin droplet**

[phpmyadmin one-click droplet](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/mysql#start)   
[same guide](http://do.co/mysql1804#start)   

********************************************************************************

Welcome to DigitalOcean's One-Click MySQL/phpMyAdmin Droplet.
To keep this Droplet secure, the UFW firewall is enabled.
All ports are BLOCKED except 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), and 3306 (MySQL).

In a web browser, you can view:
 * The MySQL/phpMyAdmin One-Click Quickstart guide: http://do.co/mysql1804#start
 * phpMyAdmin: http://111.111.111.111/phpmyadmin
    Username: admin
    Password: *********************

On the server:
 * The MySQL root password is saved in /root/.digitalocean_password
 * Certbot is preinstalled. Run it to configure HTTPS.

### setup a digitalocean account
- it helps to have an email you have access to.
- a droplet password will be sent to that email once the new droplet is created


choose an image (under marketplace)
at first i had ubuntu 18.04 highlighted
then i went to 1 click apps and chose to do a lamp on 18.04 (deprecated)
[digitalocean LAMP tutorials](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/one-clicks/lamp/)

then i destroyed that one and created a phpmyadmin droplet
[digitalocean phpmyadmin tutorials](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/one-clicks/mysql/)
[phpmyadmin docs](https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/index.html)

chose a size
standard $5 plan

select additional options
IPv6 and monitor

### [login as root](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/how-to/connect-with-console/)
[How to Connect to your Droplet with OpenSSH on Linux or macOS](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/how-to/connect-with-ssh/openssh/)
[what is OpenSSH? ](https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/O/OpenSSH.html)   
>Once you have your Droplet’s IP address, username, and password (if necessary), follow the instructions for your SSH client. OpenSSH is included on Linux and macOS. Windows users with Bash also have access to OpenSSH. Windows users without Bash can use PuTTY.

```
ssh root@SERVER_IP_ADDRESS
```
**to login as root initially you have to copy and paste the password from the email your receive from creating the droplet**
note: you will have to paste the password blind using right click paste then type enter

once you login in using the pasted password you will be asked to change the password starting with **pasting the same** initial password blindly and typing enter.

then you can blindly type and retype to confirm your desired root password.

**changing your custom root password**

### [creating a non root user](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-14-04)

1. login as root
2. add a new user
**'demo' represents name of new user**
```
$ adduser demo
```

3. give user root privileges
```
$ gpasswd -a demo sudo
```

4. add public key authentication
- generate key with keygen (already done for root) - (i can use the old key that is already there no keygen needed)
- copy the public key to the user (ssh-copy-id must be done from local machine - i navigated to the .ssh dir)
```
$ ssh-copy-id demo@SERVER_IP_ADDRESS
```
**i skipped down to upload public key to root then came back to this**

**GOTCHA:** [ssh-copy-id Permission denied (publickey).](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/ssh-permission-denied-publickey)   
> i decided not to add a password and instead added an ssh key when i created the droplet and now it only want this
> on login

```
  sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

  // in nano - sshd_config
  PasswordAuthentication yes
  ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
```

then restart the SSH service
```
  sudo systemctl restart sshd
```
> then try ssh-copy-id ... above


### Configure SSH Daemon (to disallow remote ssh root access)
open the following file
```
nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```
**GOTCHA: notice sshd_config not ssh_config**

change this line to no
```
PermitRootLogin yes
```
> also turn off PasswordAuthentication

save and exit using ctrl-x, y (for yes) and enter to confirm the default file name

### Reload SSH
```
$ service ssh restart
```

[how to restart services in linux](https://www.wikihow.com/Restart-Services-in-Linux)   
```
  $ sudo systemctl restart ssh
```
**this worked, even though the last time i did it i got not feedback**

**thats it**


### [path to www/html folder](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/what-is-the-correct-folder-to-put-my-website-files-var-www-or-var-www-html)
## **GOTCHA: in ubuntu 18.04 (plain droplet) there is no www folder until you configure apache server**
```
cd ../var/www/html
$ ls
```
**back out of ~ root folder then > var > www > html**
ls exposes the index.html file in the root html folder



### create a new root password
a root password is sent to your email account but says you will be asked to change it the first time you log into the server. so have a strong password ready when you log in.

### [how to add ssh keys to droplets](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/how-to/add-ssh-keys/)
[is it safe to use same ssh key on multiple servers?](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/27661/good-practice-to-use-same-ssh-keypair-on-multiple-machines)
**seems like its ok**

### create SSH key
**i navigated into the target dir (local .ssh dir)**
```
$   ssh-keygen.exe
```
output
**still asked to specify rout or use default**
```

Your identification has been saved in /c/Users/d3pot/.ssh/kratos/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /c/Users/d3pot/.ssh/kratos/id_rsa.pub.

```
**even though i saved the key in kratos dir and navigated into it ssh-copy-id didn't use it. it used the old one that was naturally in ~/.ssh folder**

### upload public key
[GOTCHA: ssh-copy-id no identities found error ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22530886/ssh-copy-id-no-identities-found-error)
have to be on localhost to use not on the server

[How To Point to DigitalOcean Nameservers From Common Domain Registrars](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-point-to-digitalocean-nameservers-from-common-domain-registrars)   
**open the link, find your hosting providers and follow the illustrations**
>It will take some time for the name server changes to propagate after you've saved them. During this time, the domain registrar communicates the changes you've made with your ISP (Internet Service Provider). In turn, your ISP caches the new nameservers to ensure quick site connections. This process usually takes about 30 minutes, but could take up to a few hours depending on your registrar and your ISP's communication methods.

[How To Secure Apache with Let's Encrypt on Ubuntu 18.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-apache-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-18-04)   
**NOTE: there seems to be an updated instruction for each os version - ubuntu 18.04 doesn't have certbot installed && "Certbot doesn't know how to automatically configure the web server on this system."**
```
  ~~$ sudo apt install certbot~~
```

>Certbot is in very active development, so the Certbot packages provided by Ubuntu tend to be outdated. However, the Certbot developers maintain a Ubuntu software repository with up-to-date versions, so we'll use that repository instead.

>First, add the repository:
**proper certbot installation**
```
  $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot

  //then
  $ sudo apt install python-certbot-apache
```
## [Important: make sure you finish setting up your DNS and apache virtual host](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-the-apache-web-server-on-ubuntu-18-04#step-5-%E2%80%94-setting-up-virtual-hosts)

```
  $ sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/example.com.conf
```
>look for ServerName example.com;

>revisit: Allowing HTTPS Through the Firewall

check the status:

### Obtaining an SSL Certificate
>Certbot provides a variety of ways to obtain SSL certificates through plugins. The Apache plugin will take care of reconfiguring Apache and reloading the config whenever necessary. To use this plugin, type the following:
```
  $ sudo certbot --apache -d example.com -d www.example.com
```

>Let's begin by updating the local package index to reflect the latest upstream changes:
```
  $ sudo apt update
```

>Then, install the apache2 package
```
  $ sudo apt install apache2
```

Adjusting the firewall
>List the ufw application profiles by typing:
```
  $ sudo ufw app list
```

>It is recommended that you enable the most restrictive profile that will still allow the traffic you've configured. Since we haven't configured SSL for our server yet in this guide, we will only need to allow traffic on port 80:
```
  $ sudo ufw allow 'Apache'
```

>You can verify the change by typing:
```
  $ sudo ufw status
```

>Check with the systemd init system to make sure the service is running by typing:
```
