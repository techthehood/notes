[whats the difference between useradd and adduser?](https://askubuntu.com/questions/345974/what-is-the-difference-between-adduser-and-useradd)   

To create a new standard user, use the useradd command. The syntax is as follows:
```
$ useradd <name>
```

>There is another way of creating user accounts that might be easier for first-time administrators. but you have to first install it (actually was ready on digitalOcean droplet)
```
  $ apt-get install adduser
```

Then
```
  $ adduser <name>
```

To remove a user account, enter the following command:
```
  $ userdel <name>
```

To remove the user, their home folder, and their files, use this command:
```
  $ userdel -r <name>
```

*add yourself to systemd-journal group to see the entire journalctl -xe log*

####  Get User ID and Groups Information: id and groups
To show all the user information and group memberships, we can use the id command:

```
$ id foobar
```
>// uid=1001(foobar) gid=1001(foobar) groups=1001(foobar)

We could also get all the users’ groups with the groups command:
```
  $ groups foobar
```
>// foobar : 

#### to show users

```
  id
  // or
  id user
```
> i could see my user without adding anything after id 

#### to show groups
```
  groups
```
> also doesn't need anything after groups to show you all groups

#### [adduser vs gpasswd](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/198536/difference-between-adding-sudo-user-with-adduser-or-gpasswd)   
**adduser wins**

[remove user from group](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/29570/how-do-i-remove-a-user-from-a-group)
You can use gpasswd:
```
  $ gpasswd -d user group
```
**i think deluser is better (if adduser is better)**
then the new group config will be assigned at the next login, at least on Debian. If the user is logged in, the effects of the command aren't seen immediately.

also you can use
```
  $ deluser user group
```
