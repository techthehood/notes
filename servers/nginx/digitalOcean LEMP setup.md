[Initial Server Setup with Ubuntu 18.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-18-04)   

### [login as root](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/how-to/connect-with-console/)
[How to Connect to your Droplet with OpenSSH on Linux or macOS](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/how-to/connect-with-ssh/openssh/)
[what is OpenSSH? ](https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/O/OpenSSH.html)   
>Once you have your Droplet’s IP address, username, and password (if necessary), follow the instructions for your SSH client. OpenSSH is included on Linux and macOS. Windows users with Bash also have access to OpenSSH. Windows users without Bash can use PuTTY.

```
ssh root@SERVER_IP_ADDRESS
```
**to login as root initially you have to copy and paste the password from the email your receive from creating the droplet**
note: you will have to paste the password blind using right click paste then type enter

once you login in using the pasted password you will be asked to change the password starting with **pasting the same** initial password blindly and typing enter.

then you can blindly type and retype to confirm your desired root password.

**changing your custom root password**

### [creating a non root user](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-14-04)

1. login as root
2. add a new user
**'demo' represents name of new user**
```
$ adduser demo
```

3. give user root privileges
```
$ gpasswd -a demo sudo
```

### create a new root password
a root password is sent to your email account but says you will be asked to change it the first time you log into the server. so have a strong password ready when you log in.

### [how to add ssh keys to droplets](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/how-to/add-ssh-keys/)
[is it safe to use same ssh key on multiple servers?](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/27661/good-practice-to-use-same-ssh-keypair-on-multiple-machines)
**seems like its ok**

### create SSH key
**i navigated into the target dir (local .ssh dir)**
**you can skip to upload public key if there is a public key already in the .ssh dir**
```
$   ssh-keygen.exe
```
output
**still asked to specify rout or use default**
```
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/c/Users/d3pot/.ssh/id_rsa): /c/Users/d3pot/.ssh/kratos/id_rsa
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /c/Users/d3pot/.ssh/kratos/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /c/Users/d3pot/.ssh/kratos/id_rsa.pub.

```
**even though i saved the key in kratos dir and navigated into it ssh-copy-id didn't use it. it used the old one that was naturally in ~/.ssh folder**

### upload public key
[GOTCHA: ssh-copy-id no identities found error ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22530886/ssh-copy-id-no-identities-found-error)
have to be on localhost to use not on the server
```
$ ssh-copy-id root@SERVER_IP_ADDRESS
```

output
```
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: "/c/Users/d3pot/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"

```

4. add public key authentication to non-root user
**i skipped down to upload public key to root then came back to this**
- generate key with keygen (already done for root) - (i can use the old key that is already there no keygen needed)
- copy the public key to the user (ssh-copy-id must be done from local machine - i navigated to the .ssh dir)
```
$ ssh-copy-id demo@SERVER_IP_ADDRESS
```

### disallow remote ssh root access (Configure SSH Daemon)
open the following file
```
nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```
**GOTCHA: notice sshd_config not ssh_config**

change this line to no
```
PermitRootLogin yes
```

save and exit using ctrl-x, y (for yes) and enter to confirm the default file name

### Reload SSH
**not this one**
```
$ service ssh restart
```

[how to restart services in linux](https://www.wikihow.com/Restart-Services-in-Linux)   
```
  $ sudo systemctl restart ssh
```
**this worked, even though the last time i did it i got no feedback**

**thats it**

#### [Setting up a basic firewall](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-18-04)   

see current OpenSSH profile in ufw
```
  $ ufw app list
```

make sure firewall allows OpenSSH connections
```
  $ ufw allow OpenSSH
```

enable the firewall
```
  $ ufw enable
```
>Type "y" and press ENTER to proceed.

You can see that SSH connections are still allowed by typing
```
  $ ufw status
```


### [path to www/html folder](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/what-is-the-correct-folder-to-put-my-website-files-var-www-or-var-www-html)
## **GOTCHA: in ubuntu 18.04 (plain droplet) there is no www folder until you configure apache server**
```
cd ../var/www/html
$ ls
```
**back out of ~ root folder then > var > www > html**
ls exposes the index.html file in the root html folder

#### set up nginx server blocks (virtual servers)
[How To Set Up Nginx Server Blocks (Virtual Hosts) on Ubuntu 16.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-nginx-server-blocks-virtual-hosts-on-ubuntu-16-04)

change the permissions to the user
```
  $ sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/example.com/html
```

## FOR MORE ON FILE PERMISSIONS SEE 'chmod file permissions.md'
>Create the directory for example.com as follows, using the -p flag to create any necessary parent directories:

```
  $ sudo mkdir -p /var/www/example.com/html
```

>Next, assign ownership of the directory with the $USER environmental variable:

```
  $ sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/example.com/html
```
>The permissions of your web roots should be correct if you haven't modified your unmask value, but you can make sure by typing:

```
  $ sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/example.com
```

> Next, create a sample index.html page using nano or your favorite editor:

```
  $ nano /var/www/example.com/html/index.html

actually i needed to do:

  $ cd var/www/example.com/html
  $ sudo nano index.html
```
**i need sudo for the permission to create and modify this file.**   

## **GOTCHA: i was rejected until i changed into the target directory**

>Inside, add the following sample HTML:   

```
  <html>
      <head>
          <title>Welcome to Example.com!</title>
      </head>
      <body>
          <h1>Success!  The example.com server block is working!</h1>
      </body>
  </html>
```

### create server blocks
```
  $ cd etc/nginx/sites-available
```

NOTE: copy the default as a starting template
```
  sudo cp digitalOcean example.com
```

there was a digitalOcean server block
```
  nano DigitalOcean

> You can inspect the contents of this script with nano or your preferred text editor:
> When you're done inspecting the script, run it under sudo:

  $ nano nodesource_setup.sh
  $ sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh

#### install the nodejs package
> then you can check the version

```
  $ sudo apt install nodejs
  $ nodejs -v

> In order for some npm packages to work (those that require compiling code from source, for example), you will need to install the build-essential package:

Stop an application with this command (specify the PM2 App name or id):
```
  $ pm2 stop app_name_or_id
```

Restart an application:
```
  $ pm2 restart app_name_or_id
```

List the applications currently managed by PM2:
```
  $ pm2 list
```

Get information about a specific application using its App name:
```
  $ pm2 info app_name
```

The PM2 process monitor can be pulled up with the monit subcommand. This displays the application status, CPU, and memory usage:
```
  $ pm2 monit

  <form class="" action="index.html" method="post">
